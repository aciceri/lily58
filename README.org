* My Lily58's keymap

Here is my custom keymap for my Lily58 keyboard, powered by the the
QMK firmware.
I accidentaly broke a Oled display but I had already bridged the
connections on the right half PCB, enabling it.
So, for now I've the dislay only on the left half.

I wrote a simple C program to send message to the keyboard, the
message are showed at a specified line.
For example

#+begin_src shell
./toLily 0 "Hello world!"
#+end_src

shows at the first line (the lines are indexed by 0, 1, 2, 3) the
message "Hello world!"


** Installation

Assuming that the QMK toolbox is installed and that the correct udev
rules are set, to compile and flash my custom firmware do the following:

- Clone this repository inside the QMK folder, naming it
  e.g. ~keyboards/lily58/keymaps/aciceri~
- In the QMK folder:
  - Connect the left half and ~make lily58:aciceri:flash~
  - Connect the right half and ~make lily58:aciceri:flash
    OLED_DRIVER_ENABLE=false~
- Optional: build ~toLily~ with ~gcc toLily.c -lhidapi-hidraw -o toLily~


** What's next

*** TODO Mouse keys

My workflow is keyboard centric but it could be cool to control the
mouse using the keyboard


*** TODO RAW hid (work in progress)

Using the HID protocol it's possible to send information to the
keyboard's display to visualize things like the current track title or
the current Emacs modes.
