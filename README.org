* My Lily58's keymap

Here is my custom keymap for my Lily58 keyboard, powered by the the
QMK firmware.
I accidentaly broke a Oled display but I had already bridged the
connections on the right half PCB, enabling it.
So, for now I've the dislay only on the left half.

** Installation

Assuming that the QMK toolbox is installed and that the correct udev
rules are set, to compile and flash my custom firmware do the following:

- Clone this repository inside the QMK folder, naming it
  e.g. ~keyboards/lily58/keymaps/aciceri~
- In the QMK folder:
  - Connect the left half and ~make lily58:aciceri:flash~
  - Connect the right half and ~make lily58:aciceri:flash
    OLED_DRIVER_ENABLE=false~


** What's next

*** TODO Mouse keys

My workflow is keyboard centric but it could be cool to control the
mouse using the keyboard


*** TODO RAW hid

Using the HID protocol it's possible to send information to the
keyboard's display to visualize things like the current track title or
the current Emacs modes.
